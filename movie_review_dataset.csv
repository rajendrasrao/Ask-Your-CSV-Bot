"A monumental piece of cinema.

Paced to perfection, uniquely beautiful, thought-provoking, beyond thrilling, with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding. Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring. An entire production on their A-Game.. it's an incredible technical achievement. Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special. Denis Villeneuve's love for 'Dune' shines through every stunning frame. Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful, but here he improves on it in every way. It just doesn't get better than this.",dune,10,positive
"Dune Part 2 is an epic movie; slickly made, and visually stunning.

But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book, especially the water of life scene and the final battle.

The movie had almost a 3 hour run time, but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance.

It is a beautiful movie, but it feels like it has no soul. The emotional connection between Paul and Chani, so vital to the story, is completely lacking and unbelievable. The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen.

I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things, but she has basically 2 facial expressions here, and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul. I found her to be the worst part of this movie.

The final fight scene is short, choppy, and a mess. It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish. The ending was super abrupt, and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel.

I want to reiterate that this isn't a bad movie. Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing, but he can't give life to individual characters.

It is like he can't see the trees for the forest.",dune,6,mixed
"We have waited many, many years for a movie of this caliber. I'm 59 years old, a female, grandmother and retired - this was THE. BEST. MOVIE I have ever seen. I don't tend to like si-fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor . The length of this movie wasn't even noticed by us; it wasn't long enough to be honest. We wanted MORE. It ended and we weren't done yet. We know how long it takes for sequels to come along - so who knows if I'll still be on the planet to see it. I hope I am. And I hope they can do it justice. The last time I remember a movie being THIS good: I was in high school in the 80's. DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE. CRAZY GOOD.",dune,10,positive
"I am quite surprised at the overall positive reactions for this film compared to the first one as I don't think they are comparable at all.

Unlike the first film, Inside Out 2 felt rushed and lacked the time to properly develop each character. The film lacked direction at times and felt quite disconnected. The first film had an amazing sense of journey and adventure and I think that's where this one missed the mark. The journey undertaken by the original characters simply didn't have the same sense of purpose the storyline felt forced to try and rush to the end where where we all learn lesson of the complexity of emotions are what life is about.

All in all not a bad film, the animation was still great, same with the voice acting, it just lacked the extra magic of the first and didn't quite evoke the same feelings.", Inside Out 2,6,mixed
"All in all, while ""Inside Out 2"" has a good concept and loveable characters, it is not perfect. Promoted as an entertaining event that lasts one and a half hours, it has a problem with a story. It introduces Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear again who travel through teenage Riley's mind, but it is not as profound as the first movie. While pacing appears to be slow with large chunks where not much story occurs and the audience is not able to form a bond with the character. Although the first film was emotional and deeply meaningful, ""Inside Out 2"" lacks a single, overarching message compared to its predecessor. The humor and warmth are insufficient to make up for the shoddy plot, even though some of the animation and voice acting are excellent. Younger audiences will find it entertaining, but it falls short of the first film's potential, which will disappoint some viewers who were hoping for yet another heartwarming tale.", Inside Out 2,7,mixed
"The movie follows the same characters, with an addition to new emotions, as the main girl is going through puberty.

However, this time around, there is no originality and no fun. The jokes were boring, the story was going in circles and the point of the story was the same as the one in the first movie, so no development there. At least the whole teen drama was somehow entertaining, but, in the end, it wasn't enough. The emotions, in addition, were not only annoying, but also the creators often messed up as to the right reaction to the right emotions (sadness often acted as fear...) and they also tried hard to make the new emotions the bad guys without making them the bad guys.", Inside Out 2,3,negetive
"Hugh Jackman is the perfect Wolverine. What a fun movie. I like the dialogue and clever quips with f bombs sprinkled in. It's definitely not taking itself too seriously. There is tons of fun cameos I didn't expect! I normally watch spoiler videos ahead of time, but I didn't on this occasion and I'm glad I didn't because there was some oh snap moments! It's a very good action packed fun film. The breaking the Fox jokes and speaking to the camera jokes are too funny. I can definitely see more sequels for these two on the horizon. They are promoting this movie hard I just watched these two on Hot Ones eating chicken wings They make a dynamic duo. Until your 90 Wolverine ...until your 90 lol.",Deadpool & Wolverine,9,positive
"So many Easter Eggs, so true to the comic characters, and may have possibly single handedly saved the MCU. Everything you'd expect from a deadpool movie plus. Haven't left a theatre so buzzy in a very long time. Rips to shreds the tedium of the last 5 years of the MCU and makes you think there may be life after Endgame after all. Cinematic feel was great, amazing soundtrack and I'll probably go back again over the weekend to watch again. So lucky in NZ to get these preview nights w to 3 days before the rest of the world see them. God bless you Mr's Levy, Reynolds and Jackman, a laugh a minute ride!",Deadpool & Wolverine,8,positive
"Watched it on IMAX with my parents and it was definitely worth it. It was truly entertaining and fun. Smiling and laughing from the start till the end. Also, I never thought I would see some ""old"" characters and ""old/new"" characters in this film. Many easter eggs, if you're that nerd, truly nostalgic. I could say this is one of the best multiverse film ever. Also the soundtrack for this film was great. However, the movie should have been longer because we waited for many years for this prequel. When it ended, it was bittersweet because I grew up with these movies. Thank you Deadpool, our Marvel Jesus.....and Logan, the wrong guy always. :)",Deadpool & Wolverine,8,positive
"I understand what the plan was here. They wanted a trippy film, focusing on a strong future for the Sony verse. The problem is the delivery. The camera work in this movie made it quite irritating to follow, as there was constant quick close up shots of the action. The dialogue was awful, and there was quite a lot of blatant voice over during the villain scenes.

So much wasted time was given to boring scenes in the movie, which led me to believe the screen writers finished the script and realised that it was under the word count.

Honestly the acting quality was quite poor across the board, especially the villain, who honestly seems as if they didn't cast for his role at all, just picked up someone off the side of the road.

For someone who's guilty pleasure is watching bad movies, I it was a painful time. Don't recommend.",madame web,2,negetive
"It's astonishing to think that Sony could put out a worse product than 2022's Morbius, but boy, ""Madame Web"" manages it. It is an embarrassing mess. Talented stars wasted on probably one of the worst comic book movie ever (which nobody asked for). Filled with atrocious dialogue, awkward editing and laughable structure. It's a clunky, poorly-written, messy, and sloppy movie packed with some mediocre editing and performances.

The concept is interesting on paper, but it couldn't be saved due to it's terrible execution. ""Madame Web"" simply lacked the spark it needed in nearly every dept.

There is simply nothing memorable in this movie, except maybe some superhero costumes, but that doesn't redeem the fact that the movie is bad.

So yeah...""Madame Web"" is yet another disappointing entry in the Sony's Spider-Less universe. It's like a love letter to an era of superhero films that people largely want to forget. The ""Pepsi"" adds are stand-out, it falls short of what could have been a decent movie in the hands of someone else twenty years ago.",madame web,4,negetive
"Don't waste your time, and money seeing this in theaters. I was fooled by the trailer which looked promising. All the action in the whole film ( a total of 2 scenes) is shown in the the trailer. The rest of the movie is just terrible acting trying to save an even worse scrip.

I'm honestly not sure how this made it to the big screen. I'm not a cinema expert, but shouldn't someone have to view the finished product and give the O. K. At some point before it is ""audience ready?"" I feel like that step in the process was skipped. I don't know what Marvel had to do with this film, but it certainly isn't the Iron-Man-Marvel I keep hoping they will somehow revive.

And to whom it may concern, ""my parents don't love me."" Is neither a solid backstory OR a strong character trait. I hope you eat a lot of money on this movie.",madame web,1,negetive
